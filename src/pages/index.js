            Jordan Dea-Mattson is a 35 year veteran of high tech. He wrote the
            first code for which he was paid in 1981 and has been involved in
            software development and engineering ever since. He has seen more
            technologies, programming languages, and technology fads come and go
            than he can keep track of, which has required him to embrace a
            process of continual learning, personal development, and
            reinvention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jordan has worked at Apple (he was present at and involved in the
            events of the day Steve Jobs returned following the purchase of NeXT
            by Apple), Adobe Systems, Yahoo, and a number of Silicon Valley
            startups including Ooyala and Numenta. After over 30 years in
            Silicon Valley, he has relocated to Singapore where he has been the
            VP of Engineering at TradeGecko and Carousell. He is currently Site
            Director, Singapore for Indeed.COM, the worldâ€™s largest job site.
          </p>
          <p>
            His personal passion is building and growing the software
            engineering and startup ecosystems in Singapore and throughout
            Southeast Asia. He invests significant time and energy mentoring
            students and young entrepreneurs in Singapore, as well as advising
            startups. In his free time, he trains for and competes in
            triathlons.

Last but not least we would like to thank our Silver Sponsors. Four of them
have been sponsoring us in recent years already and we are very happy to have
them back. With their combined contribution we will be able to record all
talks and upload them on Youtube for the broader Python community to see.

Solace Tech Pte. Ltd. is an IT training company aspiring to help
people to learn technology by simple premises: pre-course work before
the class, and blended learning. We blend classroom and self-paced
learning sessions to maximize hands-on ability, time flexibility, and
affordability. Try our Python class with a guarantee: if you are still
not able to create a simple program, we will give you a free seat to
join the next class.

top galleries and artists in the region and feature their work online

alongside artists who are much more established and exposed in the
market.

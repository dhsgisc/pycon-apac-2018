Better late than never, we have finally figured out how to add a news page
to this [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) powered site. We will add an RSS
feed as soon as possible, in the meantime, you might want to follow
[@pyconsg](https://twitter.com/pyconsg) on Twitter or join the [Singapore Python User Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pythonsg/) on Facebook. We will share all
news through these channels as well.

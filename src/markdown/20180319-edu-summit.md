title: "Education Summit and Young Coders' Workshops at PyCon APAC 2018"
---

For the second time in Singapore and for the first time under the
PyCon APAC umbrella we will once again host an Education Summit, a
gathering of educators focused on bringing computational thinking and
coding literacy, through Python, to the classroom and the community.

To find out more, please refer to our [Education Summit page](https://pycon.sg/edu-summit/).

Additionally, we will also host Young Coders&rsquo; Workshops, a series of
workshop from students for students (and everyone at age 18 or below.)

To learn more about the workshops, please refer to our
[Young Coders&rsquo; Workshops page](https://pycon.sg/young-coders/).

These two are free events, made possible thanks to our sponsors, but they are
separate events from the main conference, so if you would like to attend,
please fill out the registration form that is linked on the respective event
pages.

title: "Preliminary List of Talks"

As the conference date is getting closer and closer, it is about time that we
raise the curtain and have a look at the talk proposals that we were able to
accepted so far.

At this point, we would like to shout out a big thank you to all the great
people who have submitted proposals, especially those, who took the time to
submit but got rejected. We do hope that you visit the conference anyways
and submit your proposals again, next year!

We are still reviewing a lot of talk proposals that have been submitted
last-minute, so we will add around eight to ten more talks to the list. Once we
have the final list of talks, we will update the
[Conference Schedule Page](https://pycon.sg/schedule/) and let you know the
exact dates and times and rooms for each talk.

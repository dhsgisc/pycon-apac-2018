title: "Early Bird Ticket Sales Open Now!"
---

Today we would like to announce that Early Bird ticket sales for PyCon APAC
are now open.

You can purchase your ticket here: https://www.eventnook.com/event/pyconapac2018

Please note that approved speakers and workshop conductors do not need to
purchase tickets for themselves. We are still in the process of reviewing all
talk proposals, so if you submitted a proposal, please be patient. You don't
have to worry! In the unlikely event that we rejected your talk and Early Bird
sales have ended, you will still get a ticket for the Early Bird rate!

Everyone else, get your Early Bird ticket, while they last. Early Bird sales
will be available until April 15 or as long as stocks last.

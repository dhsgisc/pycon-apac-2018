Today we are happy to announce the three Platinum Sponsors for PyCon APAC 2018.
All three sponsors committed very early in our planning phase and are listed
in no specific order. It is largely to their generous contribution that we
were able to make PyCon APAC 2018 a three-day event for the first time, without
raising our ticket prices.

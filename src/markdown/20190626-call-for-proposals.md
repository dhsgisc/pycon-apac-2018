Many of you have noticed our inital call for proposals and submitted great
talks! A big thank you to all Python enthusiasts who have put in the work,
so far.

As we are aiming for our usual 2-days, 3-tracks conference, we need around
34 talks. So far, we have about 12 promising talks, so if you are still on
the fence about whether or not you should submit a talk, the answer is: "YES!
You should absolutely submit a talk" ;-)

Any topic is suitable, as along as it is somehow related to Python.
